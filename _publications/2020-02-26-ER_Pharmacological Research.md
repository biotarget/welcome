<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) comprises a network of tubules and vesicles that constitutes the largest organelle of the eukaryotic cell. Being the location where most proteins are synthesized and folded, it is crucial for the upkeep of cellular homeostasis. Disturbed ER homeostasis triggers the activation of a conserved molecular machinery, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), that comprises three major signaling branches, initiated by the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Given the impact of this intricate signaling network upon an extensive list of cellular processes, including protein turnover and autophagy, ER stress is involved in the onset and progression of multiple diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. There is, for this reason, an increasing number of publications focused on characterizing and/or modulating ER stress, which have resulted in a wide array of techniques employed to study ER-related molecular events. This review aims to sum up the essentials on the current knowledge of the molecular biology of endoplasmic reticulum stress, while highlighting the available tools used in studies of this nature.
